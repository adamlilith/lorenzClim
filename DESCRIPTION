Description: Create historical and future climate variables that match
	paleoclimate variables based on Lorenz et al. (2016 Scientific Data;
	doi: 10.1038/sdata.2016.48). Lorenz et al. present two North American
	paleoclimate data reconstructions from the last glacial maximum to the
	present, plus future climate scenario products from the Coupled Model
	Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for 12 global circulation models.
	The variables in the future climate scenarios are not all the same as those
	in the paleoclimate reconstructions. Tools in this package can be used to
	reconstruct the same variables as in the paleoclimate data, over a
	user-specified period of time (from 2006 through 2100) for Representative
	Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5.
